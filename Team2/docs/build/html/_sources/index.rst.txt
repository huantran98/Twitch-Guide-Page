StuffToDo
==================

About
######

As busy college students, one of the biggest challenges we face is keep track of all the things to do. Students have many classes throughout the day, multiple assignments to do, study for other classes, and may have their own errands to run. With this issue in mind, our group felt this to be an interesting challenge to take on and decided to create **StuffToDo**.
